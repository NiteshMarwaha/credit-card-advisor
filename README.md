# System Architecture
## Components

* Streamlit Frontend (app.py) - User interface for the application

* Agent Handler (agent_handler.py) - Conversational AI logic

* Card Database (card_database.py) - Credit card data management

* Data File (credit_cards.json) - Credit card information

# Agent Flow Documentation
## Conversation Flow
Initialization:

* System creates a new conversation with the AI agent

* Sets up message history tracking

## Data Collection:

Asks series of questions to gather:

* Monthly income

* Spending categories

* Preferred benefits

* Credit score

## Data Processing:

* Normalizes user responses

* Stores in structured format

* Handles edge cases (unknown credit scores, etc.)

## Recommendation Generation:

* Filters cards based on eligibility

* Ranks cards by reward rate and fees

* Returns top 5 recommendations

# Prompt Design
## The agent uses a structured prompt template with:

* System Message: Defines the agent's role as a credit card advisor

* Message History: Maintains conversation context

* User Input: Current user response

Example prompt structure:

``` text
System: You are a helpful credit card advisor...
[Previous conversation history]
Human: {current user input}
```

# Data Normalization
## The system normalizes user inputs for:

* Spending Categories: Maps various terms to standardized categories

* Preferred Benefits: Standardizes reward types

* Numerical Values: Converts income and credit scores to numbers

# Customization
## To modify the system:

* Add/Remove Questions: Edit the QUESTIONS list in app.py

* Update Card Database: Modify credit_cards.json

* Change Recommendation Logic: Adjust filter_cards and rank_cards in card_database.py

## Troubleshooting
* No Recommendations: Check debug prints in console for filtering issues

* API Errors: Verify OpenAI API key is valid

* Data Issues: Ensure credit_cards.json is properly formatted
